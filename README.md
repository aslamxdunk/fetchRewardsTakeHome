### Let's Get Started!

# First you want to download all files, in whatever way you wish! 

Next you want to make sure you have Node.js installed https://nodejs.org/en/download/

*Lastly for the setup* we are going to install all of our Node.js packages used in my code.

In your terminal write: 
$npm i csv-parser
$npm i fs

## Once you have all files in one folder.

Go into your terminal/shell and write

$ *node index.js 5000 transactions.csv*


## You should see this as your result!
